# cowmilk

cowmilk is a platform designed for artists to publish their works. cowmilk works by providing a centralized space for uploading and managing their contents.

The idea is derived from [web.fc2.com](http://web.fc2.com), which is a website originated in Japan used for publishing virtually any digital media entertainment you can find.

We plan to support these entertainment formats initially:
- **Comic**: complete with an interactive image viewer and
- **Novel**: *Features TBD*.

Each and every artist will have their own independent page complete with configurable commenting section for community, and a planned support for ads given enough daily views for [Adsense Host](https://developers.google.com/adsense/host/).
